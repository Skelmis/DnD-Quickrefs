##### Forgotten Vessel

Item type: Wondrous item (Vessel)
Rarity: Uncommon
Requires attunement: Yes

A seemingly ordinary vessel that was probably someones property before. It holds a holy symbol in the middle...

**Ephemeral Precision:** If your hit points changed from what they were during your last turn, you gain the following benefits for this turn. Your need to roll 1 less to score a critical hit and if you do, it deals 1d6 radiant damage

###### The int-sanity ring

Attuning to this ring grants a +3 to intelligence but sacrifices a -3 to wisdom. Once attuned it cannot be removed.

"You were too focused on whether or not you could to ask whether or not you should"

###### DoomPlate

Wondrous item, rare, cursed

This highly ornate armor offers excellent protection to its owner (+1 full plate) but its true power comes to light once it has failed to protect the warrior.

When the wearer of a DoomPlate drops to 0HP it will not collapse. The bearer of a doomplate will be able to continue fighting for three rounds, automatically attacking the nearest target. During this time, its bearer will normally make death saving throws. The bearer is immune to frightened or charmed in these rounds.

###### Gleaming Canopy

Wondrous item (pendant)
Rare
Requires attunement by paladin or cleric

This ornamental pendant crafted from shimmering glass resembles a delicate leaf, radiating an aura of natural grace and serenity.

**Aura of renewal**: Whenever the attuned wielders ability or spell causes an ally to be healed, a condition or curse to be removed, or a disease to be cured, that ally gains temporary hit points equal to the wielders spellcastying ability modifier.

**Natures divinity**: Once per short rest, as a reaction to an ally being attacked the attuned wielder can cast *Shield of faith* without expending a spell slot

**Living Shadows**: When a creature enters a space within 10 feet of you, you can expend 1 charge and use your reaction to cause a shadowy tendril to lash out at that creature. Make an attack roll (+7 to hit) dealing 3d6 necrotic on a hit.
