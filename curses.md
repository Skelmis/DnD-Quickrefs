Curses

#### Your power wanes

All your damage dice are reduced one size

*d12 -> d10 -> d8 -> d6 -> d4 -> d2*

The only way to break this curse is to:
- Receive the blessing of an enemy
- Destroy a place that you once protected
- Steal the power of someone who trusted you
- Kill a monster whom has never caused harm

Completing any two of these tasks will end the curse. Completing all four increases your damage dice one size, permanently.
