Some backstories I think would make for an interesting NPC or PC

---

- Public motivation: X killed my parents and I need to find them
- Implication publicly: Revenge quest
- Actual motivation: I hired X to kill my parents but haven't had the opportunity to pay him for it yet

Can be quite sinister with it and could be interesting to see how long it takes for someone to figure out.

Fun comments to use:
- There is a debt that needs to be settled
- They will get what they deserve
